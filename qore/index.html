      <h2>About QORE</h2>
      <p>
        QORE was founded in 2023 by four ambitious students and later expanded to include a fifth co-owner. Since then, the company has helped 
        a range of businesses by delivering tailored ICT solutions. QORE consists of several specialized branches—Experience-Swap, Q-Experience, 
        and Q-Vision—each focused on solving specific challenges or introducing innovative technologies.

      <h2>Experience Swap</h2>

      <div id="experience-text" class="sub-text hidden">
        <p>It all started with <strong>Experience Swap</strong>, a school project that evolved into the development of an innovative app. 
          This app uses a smart algorithm to recommend personalized locations to users every day. You can discover new places, follow fellow 
          travelers, and share your own neighborhood. What makes Experience Swap truly unique? You can “travel without traveling” by ordering 
          a culture kit filled with local dishes and cultural items from the destination you’ve virtually explored.</p>
        <p><em>Motto: Travel without traveling.</em></p>

      <h2>Q-Experience</h2>

      <div id="qexperience-text" class="sub-text hidden">
        <p>Half a year later, <strong>Q-Experience</strong> was born.
          In collaboration with Wildlands Zoo in Emmen, the team was tasked with calculating the wait time at the Serenga Safari attraction.
          By installing ESP cameras above the queue, every visitor who crosses a line is counted. The system then calculates the current wait time in real time, based on the number of people in line and the number of available trucks.
          The display updates every second—a smart and effective solution that is now being used successfully.</p>

      <h2>Q-Vision</h2>

      <div id="qvision-text" class="sub-text hidden">
        <p><strong>Q-Vision</strong> was approached by the International Weather Agency (IWA) with a request to modernize their system.
          The result? A secure, custom-built web application with real-time sensor failure logging, a REST API with JWT authentication,
          and complete documentation via OpenAPI. The application delivers accurate and confidential weather data worldwide, detects faulty data,
          and is easy to integrate with any system that supports HTTP requests.</p>
